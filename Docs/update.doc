@addindex update

You can use these steps to update your local TickZoomPublic clone to another, usually, the latest
version of TickZoom.

@note
Please ignore references to autosetuprebase in the previous version of this documentation since
it turns out that does not apply to this situation.

Okay. to update you need to open a Git Bash prompt on the folder that holds your local clone of
the TickZoomPublic project and then enter these commands:

Explanation of these follows.

@verbatim 
git stash
git pull --rebase upstream integrate
git push
git stash apply
@endverbatim

@note
You should consider creating a new branch on your local repository prior to updating. That way,
you may easily check out your previous branch if you encounter any serious difficulty. But you 
can also use "git rebase --abort" if you have problems to reset things back how they were.

Here's the low down of each of these commands:

-# git stash - "Stashes" any of your uncommitted changes which means that it extracts them
from the code and stores them in a separate buffer so you can re-apply them later. For example,
these might be changes you make to app.config files or other configuration which you never want to commit
permanently.
-# git pull --rebase - Pulls the latest version of code from the upstream repository. "integrate" may
be replaced by another available branch name such as "stable" or "master".  For "upstream" you can 
replace it with someone else's repository whose changes you wish to add to yours.
@note See below about how to handle conflicts.
-# git push - Pushes the update into your fork project on GitHub so that it
remains current. it also pushes up any code which you have committed to make it available for others
to includes in their projects and for committers to include in the official TickZoomPublic.
-# git stash apply This recalls your changes that you previously stashed and merges them into the updated
code. At this point you may find "conflicts" which are easiest to resolve using the TortoiseGit features
called "Check for Modifications" and double click on the file that has conflicts to fix it using a 
graphical side-by-side diff.

@section update_conflicts How Resolve Pull Conflicts

Since the git pull is using rebase, you need to understand how rebase works so as to easily resolve any issues.
The git pull (using rebase) performs the following tasks:

-# Rewinds your local branch to the most recent matching commit between your branch and the remote branch.
-# Saves all your commits since that matching commit to a buffer.
-# Recursively updates your branch with the latest commits from the remote branch. 
   This particular step can never produce conflicts. That's one of benefits of using rebase instead of merge.
-# Next, rebase begins applying your local commits one at a time on top of the latest. At this point you 
   may or may not get conflicts for several reasons explained below.
-# The git pull (using rebase) will stop at each of your commits that has a conflict and allow you to resolve it.
   @note In many cases your commits will have zero conflicts because your commit was already absorbed into the
   official branch or simply because it applied cleanly.
 
@section conflict_reasons Possible Reasons for Conflict and How to Resolve

-# You made a change that TickZoom committer absorbed it into the official branch but with minor modification.
   -# In this case, git pull will stop and offer you to resolve the conflict.
   -# You can then look at the conflict using TortoiseGit, Check for Modifications and double-click on the files in conflict.
   -# If you see that this is the situation, then you should run the command "get rebase --skip" which will throw away
      your commit in favor of keeping the official commit. 
   -# However, this decision is up to you. So if you feel that your commit was applied to the official code improperly for some reason then contact support.
-# You made a commit that has not yet been applied to the official branch or was rejected and now it conflicts with other changes to the official branch.
   -# In this case, git pull will stop and offer you to resolve the conflict.
   -# You can then look at the conflict using TortoiseGit, Check for Modifications and double-click on the files in conflict.
   -# In this situation, you probably will want to actually resolve the conflicts using the side-by-side diff from TortoiseGit and
      keep your modifications. If you feel your modification should have been added to the official branch already, contact support.
