@section vs_setup Setup Visual Studio for TickZoom

   -# TickZoom now fully supports Visual Studio 2008 with support for 2010 soon.
   -# In Visual Studio, the feature that pops up dialog boxs for unhandled exceptions must be disable (which it is already by default when you open the solution provided by TickZoom.
   This must be disabled because of a defect in Visual Studio where it intercepts ordinary exceptions passed between DLLs. If you enable this, you will continually get dialog boxes popping up when using Visual Studio with TickZoom.
   -# If for any reason it gets enabled again, here are the steps in VS 2008, to disable:  Select the "Debug" menu from the top menu bar. Then click "Exceptions...". On the dialog box, uncheck the box beside "Common Language Runtime Exceptions"  under the column "User-Unhandled".  Then select Okay and exit the dialog box.

The fast way to get support is to email support@tickzoom.com. That address fires email instantly plus automatically opens a private ticket in the issue tracking system.

NOTE: The issue tracking system totally private now because the existing TickZoom customers voted to keep everything related to their trading private.
